# AudioManipulation
Java Speech processing audio segmentation detection

It is a Java program to achieve such functions:

1. transfer other format of audio file(such as mp3, or other format but I've just test mp3) into audio file in wav format(maybe other format is also access)

2. audio segment

3. onset detection

It is a rough code and adjustment is needed.

I may update it in fulture.
